This is a quiz web-app created as part of the Web Technologies module on the University of Bristol MSc Computer Science (conversion) course. Users browse from a selection of multiple choice quizzes, and can also upload their own quizzes via an on-site form. Angular.js was used for most of the client-side, while a combination of Javascript and SQLite was used for server-side.

To view the site locally:
1. Install sqlite3 and node.js
2. In the terminal, navigate to the kwizzical folder and type: node server
3. visit localhost:8080 in your web browser

*Making an amazing website

Note about ports:
Apparently processes running without root privileges cannot bind
to ports below 1024 - found this out while trying to set up a server
in the labs. I've set the ports int server.js to a couple of random numbers higher than this for now
